<HR WIDTH="100%"><B><FONT SIZE=+2>SuperMail ResourceEditor Plug-in Example</FONT></B>

<P>This example shows you how to create a plug-in for the ResourceEditor
and integrate with the Netscape Admin Server 4.0 Users and Groups editor.
The example is a plug-in to edit user entries. You can follow these steps
to create plug-ins to edit group and organizational unit entries as well.

<P>The Directory Server should have an object class named <TT>SuperMailUser</TT>.
When the example
<BR>calls a SuperMailUser object, the user and group editor displays the
proper UI plug-in.
<H2>

<HR NOSHADE SIZE=1>Plug-in Steps</H2>


<P><B>Step 1. Define a new object class called SuperMailUser and update
the Directory Server</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This has been done in the <TT>SuperMailSchema.conf</TT> file.
In order to update the directory server with this schema, copy the file
to this directory: <TT><I>&lt;server-root></I>/slapd-<I>&lt;servername></I>/config</TT>

<P>Suppose you have installed the Netscape Directory Server in <TT>/usr/netscape/server4</TT>
and named the server as <TT>corporate</TT>. Copy the <TT>SuperMailSchema.conf</TT>
file to this directory:&nbsp;&nbsp; <TT>/usr/netscape/server4/slapd-corporate/config</TT>.

<P>In addition, you must edit the&nbsp; <TT>/usr/netscape/server4/slapd-corporate/config/ns-schema.conf</TT>
file to include the <TT>SuperMailSchema.conf</TT> file.

<P>After doing this, restart the Directory Server to pick up the new schema
information.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Step 2. Modify the default object classes for users to include the SuperMailUser
object class</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The <TT>AddSuperMailUser.ldif</TT> file contains the necessary
changes to modify the entry at:
<BR><TT>dn: cn=user, cn=defaultObjectClassesContainer, ou=4.0, ou=Admin,
ou=Global Preferences, ou=mcom.com, o=NetscapeRoot</TT>.

<P>This entry is used by the <TT>ResourceEditor</TT> to determine which
object classes need to be edited for a user. Note that <TT>ou=mcom.com</TT>
should be changed to the domain name was used during the installation of
the Console and Directory Server.

<P>To modify the default object classes for users, first modify the <TT>AddSuperMailUser.ldif</TT>
file as necessary, then do an <TT>ldapmodify -f AddSuperMailUser.ldif</TT>.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Step 3. Add the resource editor extension class for the SuperMailUser
object class</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The <TT>SuperMailUser.ldif</TT> file contains the necessary
changes to add the entry at:

<P><TT>dn: cn=superMailUser, cn=ResourceEditorExtension, ou=4.0, ou=Admin,
ou=Global Preferences, ou=mcom.com, o=NetscapeRoot</TT>.

<P>This entry is used by the <TT>ResourceEditor</TT> to instantiate the
plug-ins for editing a user entry. Note that <TT>ou=mcom.com</TT> should&nbsp;
be changed to the domain name was used during the installation of the Console
and Directory Server.

<P>To add the resource editor extension, first modify the <TT>SuperMailUser.ldif</TT>
file as necessary, then perform an <TT>ldapmodify -a -f SuperMailUser.ldif</TT>.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Step 4. Copy the jar files to <TT><I>&lt;server-root></I>/java/jars</TT>
directory</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>To get this example working, copy the <TT>SuperMailUGPlugin.jar</TT>
and <TT>SuperMailUGPlugin_en.jar</TT> files to the <TT><I>&lt;server-root></I>/java/jars</TT>
directory.

<P>Using the above example of an installation at <TT>/usr/netscape/server4</TT>,
the target directory is <TT>/usr/netscape/server4/java/jars</TT>.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Step 5. Start the console</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Run <TT>/usr/netscape/server4/startconsole</TT>.</BLOCKQUOTE>
To see the installed plug-in, log in. Go to the User and Groups Tab and
create a new user.
<BR>You see the SuperMail User Tab.
